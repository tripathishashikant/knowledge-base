To store notes related to things I learn

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for learning and implementing various concepts in computer science and software development. It includes:

- **Data Structures**: Implementation and notes on basic and advanced data structures.
- **Algorithms**: Detailed explanations and implementations of algorithms, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Front-End Development**: Notes and examples on JavaScript concepts like closures, `call`, `apply`, and `bind`.

The goal is to provide a structured and organized resource for continuous learning and reference. Many more things will come in the future!
